## TODO

-   [ ] handle uneven populations

# Problems To Solved

1. OneMax
2. Speller
3. Knapsack
4. 5 Queens

# Problems To Solve

1. Navigate a 2D grid maze
2. Traveling salesman

## Possible Others

-   making a travel schedule generator
    -   input places you want to go (google api for location and hours)
    -   also include what kind of activity (food, dessert, active, sight seeing, coffee) (this could be taken from google potentially)
        -   we don't want two of the same activity back to back
    -   how long you want at each place
    -   input days you are there total
    -   input when you are looking to wake up and go to bed
    -   input times you would like to eat (roughly)
    -   the algorithm should try not to put food back to back
    -   it outputs an itinerary

## Process

-   For each problem, show the classical solution with benchmarks and compare to the Maeve solution with benchmarks.
-   Label each problem with: **Binary**, **Permutation**, **Real-Value** or any other genotypes covered.

# Maeve Docs

What is Maeve? A framework to use parameterized inputs to create and utilize genetic algorithms easily. The idea is it's easy to experiment with different parameters, observe the results, then when you've found the parameters that work best for your solution, run the framework in performance mode to calculate at a very efficient rate.
