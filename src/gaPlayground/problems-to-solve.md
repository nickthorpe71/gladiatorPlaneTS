## TODO

-   [ ] find a tree-based example of a problem to solve
-   [ ] handle uneven populations
-   [ ] work towards not having to write much code can just input parameters

-   -   > example: fr genotype function input type (binary, permutation, real-value, tree) and length of chromosome, potential values, etc., and the algorithm creates the function for you

# Problems Maeve Should Be Able to Solve

## Elementary

1. OneMax
2. Speller

## Advanced

1. Navigate a 2D grid maze
2. Traveling salesman
3. Knapsack
4. 5 Queens

## Possible Others

-   making a travel schedule generator
    -   input places you want to go (google api for location and hours)
    -   also include what kind of activity (food, dessert, active, sight seeing, coffee) (this could be taken from google potentially)
        -   we don't want two of the same activity back to back
    -   how long you want at each place
    -   input days you are there total
    -   input when you are looking to wake up and go to bed
    -   input times you would like to eat (roughly)
    -   the algorithm should try not to put food back to back
    -   it outputs an itinerary

## Process

-   For each problem, show the classical solution with benchmarks and compare to the Maeve solution with benchmarks.
-   Label each problem with: **Binary**, **Permutation**, **Real-Value** or any other genotypes covered.
